Welcome to MAC - Marketplace for Advertisers and Creators. Our platform, deployed on Starknet's blockchain, revolutionizes the way advertisers and content creators collaborate. By using our service, creators get paid in cryptocurrencies for generating traffic, while advertisers benefit from a transparent and fraud-proof system.


## ðŸŽ¯Â Challenges

**1. Receiving payment:** defaults, high cross-border fees, and non-streaming payments (not spread out over all days).

**2. Negotiation and agreements:** remuneration far from expected.

**3. Drafting a contract:** lack of predictability, need for legal knowledge, uncertainty about fulfillment.

**4. Prospecting advertisers:** difficulty in finding, uncertainty about responses.

## ðŸš€Â Our solution

### ðŸ“ˆÂ Business Model

- Technology provided by the National Treasury and Central Bank together, ensuring **alignment of interests and completeness** in the operation of tokenizing national treasury bonds;
- **Strategic partnerships** with banks and financial institutions, to scale usage and promote the network effect for this solution;
- System developed with **interoperability**, so that holders of government bonds can use them as collateral **at any financial institution**.

### ðŸ’»Â Robust and Innovative Technology

- **Smart Contracts in Cairo** for functional and complete solution deployed on Goerli (**integrated with Pragma Oracles**, allowing BTC and ETH payments!);
- **Back-end** for storing relevant off-chain data.
- Functional and integrated **Front-end** for simulation and benchmarking with an extremely simple user experience;
- **MAC Redirect Service (MAC-R)** deployed and working. **For example this is how you can be redirected for Google: https://mac-url.vercel.app/test**
- **Madara** app chain, allowing scalable payments.

### ðŸ˜ŒÂ Easy to use

Despite the robust technology provided by our solution, we believe that mass adoption of this solution can only occur if it is simple for the end-user. Therefore, we have adopted a traditional Web2/3 login model, which users make a traditional Web2 login and the connect their wallets (Argent X or Braavos).

- **No need to understand Web 3**;
- **No red tape**;
- **No need to keep your private keys on your own**.

Hence, we offer Smart Contracts and APIs for banks, which will deliver a **simple journey** to obtain credit and manage these operations.
